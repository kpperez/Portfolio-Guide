# Exploratory Data Analysis

| Project Link | Tools | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| :book:[GoodReads](https://nbviewer.org/github/kpperez/GoodReads-NLP-Analysis/blob/main/GoodReads-NLP.ipynb) |  Python | **Natural Language Processing:** A textual trend analysis utilizing word clouds as visualizations. The primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Goodreads' "Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once" list, consisting of over 10,000 titles. The project aims to identify recurring patterns and themes in the literary landscape through sophisticated text extraction and analysis of book descriptions. Additionally, an artistic element is introduced by creating visually compelling word clouds in the shape of books. |
| :anatomical_heart: [CardioHealth Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kpperez/cardiohealth-risk-assessment-logistic-regression) | Python | The CardioHealth Risk Assessment Dataset includes comprehensive medical and demographic data from patients, covering factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits. This dataset is ideal for developing and evaluating machine learning models aimed at predicting heart disease risk, serving as a crucial resource for enhancing diagnostic precision and patient outcomes in cardiovascular health. |
| :credit_card:[Ecommerce Sales Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/kpperez/Online-Retailer-EDA/blob/main/PXecommerce.ipynb) | Python | In this folder, you will find a Python-based Data Exploratory Analysis of a UK online retailer using a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset comprises 500k+ rows and 8 columns, necessitating data cleaning, engineering, and preprocessing. Visualizations were crafted using Plotly Express for interactive exploration. The project concludes with high-level business and database management recommendations. | 
| :briefcase:[HR Employee Report](https://github.com/kpperez/HR-Employee-Report/tree/main) | MySQL & PowerBI | Discover the insights on a Human Resources dataset utilizing MySQL for cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. With a dataset of over 22k rows, this project provides a deep understanding of employee demographics, departmental distribution, and organizational structure. |
| :zap:[Renewable Energy Proposal](https://github.com/kpperez/CO-Renewable-Energy/tree/main) | Excel, Tableau & PowerPoint | A comprehensive Tableau dashboard and PowerPoint presentation focused on the topic of transitioning to renewable energy, specifically hydroelectric generation. The dashboard presents insightful visualizations of energy consumption patterns and strategically identified areas along Colorado's Western Slope to build hydroelectric dams. The primary objective was to propose strategically positioned dam locations to the Colorado Secretary of State for future consideration. |

# Web Scraping

| Project Link | Tools | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| :weight_lifting_man: [Workout Webscraper](https://github.com/kpperez/Workout-Webscraper/blob/main/Workout_Webscraper.ipynb) | Python | In this project I scraped exercise data from a website to create a workout database for my Fittbook Web Application. Using Selenium Webdriver I was able to avoid pop-up advertisements and scroll through hundreds of pages to get over 1000 different workouts. |
| :house_with_garden:[Zillow](https://github.com/kpperez/Zillow-Web-Scraper/blob/main/zillow_scraper.ipynb)  | Python | This project employs web scraping techniques, utilizing Selenium WebDriver, to gather comprehensive real estate data from Zillow. With a disguised user agent and dynamic page loading addressed, we extract key information. The harvested data is organized into a structured data frame and is saved as a CSV file for convenient storage and future reference in the home-buying process. |
